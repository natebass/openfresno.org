# The main GitHub Action that runs on pushes targeting the default branch. It is based on the sample workflow for building and deploying a Next.js site to GitHub Pages.
#
# Settings
# - Timeout if running for 15 minutes.
# - Set permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages.
# - Allow only one concurrent deployment. Cancel in-progress runs when a newer commit is pushed, since the newer version supersedes the old one.
# - Contains two jobs: build-and-test and deploy.
# - Run tests only on pull requests.
#
# Features
# - Cache npm packages and Playwright browser binaries to speed up subsequent runs.
# - Cancel old runs if new code is pushed.
# - Allow running manually from the Actions tab.
# - Only upload Playwright report on failure to save storage.
#
# Automatic basePath injection and server side image optimization are disabled. It can be re-enabled if MDX support is removed. This would simplify a lot of the custom basepath logic.
