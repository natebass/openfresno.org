# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to hello@openfresno.org. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

The Open Fresno team will review it thoroughly and get back to you.
