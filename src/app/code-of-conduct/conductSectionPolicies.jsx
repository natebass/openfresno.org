            the example policy

          from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other
          volunteers.
          <br />
          <br />
          This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio
          LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth
          Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner,
          Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the
          policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix,
          Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.
